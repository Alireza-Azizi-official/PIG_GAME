<<------------------- PIG GAME ----------------------->>
It's a 4 player game (which could be more or less).
First you need to roll a dice as a player  between 1 to 6.
Each time you roll a dice the number you get, will be added to your score.
You can roll a dice as many times as you want.
!BUT!
If you get a (1) then your scores will become 0 and you will loose.
So the person who reaches to 50 first is the winner.
